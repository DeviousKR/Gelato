    <p id="germany">When diners think of Germany, their minds are likely to
      wander to traditional foods like schnitzel, sausage, pretzels and beer.
      But according to a new study by the market research firm Canadean, Germany
      is becoming an ice cream nation.</p>
    <p>In 2013, Germany boasted the most lucrative market for ice cream in Europe
      at $2.7 billion (2.01 billion euros), beating out the inventors of the
      cool delight, Italy.</p>
    <p>Last year Germany produced a staggering 627 million liters of ice cream,
      according to the website markeneis.de. Of that, 80 percent was produced
      industrially, 17 percent commercially and the remaining 3 percent for the
      soft-serve sector.<p>
    <p>Germans, forever proponents of Gemütlichkeit, still prefer to enjoy ice
      cream in the comfort of their own homes.
      German's have a "high desire for indulgence" in ice cream
      For children, ice cream is an accessory to life's most important events -
      a birthday party without Jell-O and ice cream would be like Christmas
      without the beloved Stollen fruit cake.</p>
    <p>But today, it is adults who are leading Germany's ice cream revolution.
      According to the Canadean report, people over 55 are responsible for
      almost 40 percent of the country's ice cream consumption - although they
      only make up a third of the population.</p>
    <p>By contrast, Germans under 18 only gobble up 15 percent of all that ice
      cream.</p>

    <p id="france">Berthillon is a French manufacturer and retailer of luxury
      ice cream and sorbet, with its primary store on the Île Saint-Louis in
      Paris, France. The company is owned and operated by the Chauvin family,
      descendants of the eponymous Monsieur Berthillon, who from 1954 operated a
      restaurant on the premises called "Le Bourgogne".</p>
    <p>The ice cream shop became famous in 1961 when a French restaurant guide
      Gault Millau wrote about "this astonishing ice cream shop hidden in a
      bistro on the Ile Saint-Louis."</p>

      Porettana 158/4de
      This bright, colorful gourmet gelato shop has super creamy gelato,
      beautiful gelato cakes and gelato sandwiches.  Try to pick from many of
      the standard flavors plus creative mixes like cherry with almond crunch.
      You can select from cup, cone or make a giant brioche (sweet bread) gelato
      sandwich! The flavors are kept under metal tins but just ask for a flavor
      description or a sample to taste.</p>

      Bright lights invite you into their wide selection of yummy flavours, a
      favourite being the candy/chocolate/candy bar mixed into the super creamy
      gelato base.  How can you go wrong?  Certainly in my opinion the Best in

        11 Fun Ice Cream Facts That Will Blow Your Mind
        Who doesn’t love some fun ice cream facts to kick of the summer?
      </p>
      <p>
        It turns out that ice cream is more than just a dessert. This cool
        treat has a bit of a history, and we’re going to explore it with you.
        Whether you’re winning your next trivia game or impressing your loved
        one over a shared pint of ice cream, you can now blow them away with
        your knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might already know some of these cool facts. But some are definitely
        going to surprise you. We’ve shown you an interesting ice cream
        infographic before. Now, we’re counting down even more of the best fun
        ice cream facts and tidbits we can find.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>1. The Introduction of Ice Cream is Unclear</h3>
        No one really knows who invented ice cream. We have bits and pieces of
        information. It’s enough to put together a basic story, but we don’t
        have all of the answers.
        In Ancient Rome, Emperor Nero enjoyed mixing snow with fruit and honey.
        Some historians credit Marco Polo with being the first one to bring some
        type of ice cream to Europe. He had learned it from the Chinese, who had
        flavored snow with rice and milk to make a creamy dessert.
      </p>
      <p>
        From there, it progressed. Eventually, ice cream recipes reached the
        United States a few centuries after Christopher Columbus landed on
        American soil.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>2. Ice Cream Sundaes Were Actually Made For Sundays</h3>
        There are two competing stories about the invention of the ice cream
        sundae. Here is the most popular one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ice cream sodas were a popular drink you could buy at the local soda
        shop. However, religious laws forbade shop owners from selling them on
        Sundays because people were not allowed to indulge in the sugary treats
        on the Sabbath.
      </p>
      <p>
        The owner of Ed Berners’ Ice Cream Parlor, Edward Berners, decided to
        get around this law. One day, he served a customer ice cream soda
        without the actual soda part, so it was just ice cream and syrup.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, the concoction was sold on Sundays as an alternative to ice cream
        sodas. However, it became so popular it was sold every day. Berners
        changed the spelling to “sundae” to avoid associating it with the holy
        Sabbath.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>3. The Waffle Cone Was Invented by Accident</h3>
        In 1904, an ice cream vendor ran out of cones. He was at the World’s
        Fair in St. Louis, Missouri, and he was facing high demand from guests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Desperate for a solution, he turned to a waffle vendor nearby.
        Together, they came up with the idea to mold the waffles into cones and
        serve the ice cream in there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Customers loved the idea, and the waffle cone was officially born.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>4. America Loves Ice Cream!</h3>
        The United States is one of the top 3 countries in the world with the
        highest ice cream consumption.
      </p>
      <p>
        California is the country’s top ice cream producer. That’s no surprise,
        since it’s also the top dairy producer in the country.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can you guess what America’s favorite flavor is? If you guessed
        chocolate, rocky road, or cookies n’ creme, you’re wrong. It’s actually
        vanilla.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>5. The Ingredients of the First Handwritten Ice Cream Recipe Will</h3>
        Disgust You Sometime around 1668, English noblewoman Lady Anne Fanshawe
        wrote down the first official ice cream recipe. She originally called it
        “icy cream,” and it called for some pretty strange things.
      </p>
      <p>
        To prepare the ice cream, the recipe states to boil cream with mace. If
        that doesn’t throw you off, wait till you see what comes next.
      </p>
      <p>
        For flavor, Fanshawe wrote to use orange flower or ambergris with some
        sugar. If you don’t know what ambergris is, it is essentially whale
        vomit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Occasionally, sperm whales suffer from a buildup in their intestines,
        which ends up coming up in the form of a vomit-like substance. This is
        known as ambergris, and in the past it was commonly used to make things
        like candles or perfumes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>6. Which Came First: Chocolate or Vanilla?</h3>
        If you thought the answer was vanilla, you’re wrong. Chocolate was
        actually invented first.
      </p>
      <p>
        We generally assume that vanilla ice cream came first because it’s the
        common base that creates many other flavors. However, it wasn’t always
        that way.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>7. Ice Cream Used to be a Luxury</h3>
        Back in the day, ice cream was seen as a luxurious dessert that only the
        elite could enjoy. It was considered rare and exotic, and remained this way until the late 1800s.
      </p>
      <p>
        The elite and rich upper-class society members were the only ones who
        could afford the imported ingredients and the cold storage.
      </p>
      <p>
        These were also the days before the commercialization and manufacturing
        of ice cream. Therefore, it wasn’t as easy to get for everyone, which
        led to the exclusivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>8. There is an Ice Cream Fruit in Hawaii</h3>
        That’s right. There’s a Hawaiian fruit that tastes exactly like vanilla
        ice cream. It’s called the inga feuillei, but locals call it the ice
        cream bean.
      </p>
      <p>
        It grows on perennial trees in hot climates, and it is enjoyed in many
        different ways by locals.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>9. Astronaut Ice Cream Has Never Actually Been to Space</h3>
        You’ve probably seen astronaut ice cream in a handful of gift shops and
        candy stores. It’s essentially freeze-dried ice cream.
      </p>
      <p>
        But astronaut ice cream is actually not used on space missions. In fact,
        astronaut ice cream has never been to space at all. Some reports have
        said it did once, on the Apollo 7 mission in 1968.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, those reports have been dismissed by Walter Cunningham,
        the only living astronaut on that mission, who claims that there was
        never such a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        NASA scientists are now coming up with new inventions to help astronauts
        enjoy ice cream in space. However, this form of ice cream isn’t exactly
        the freeze-dried Neapolitan you might have tasted as a kid.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>10. There’s a Simple Trick to Help Brain Freeze</h3>
        The real word for brain freeze is sphenopalatine ganglioneuralgia.
        But you can keep calling it brain freeze or frozen headache.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is brain freeze? In simple terms, you have temperature sensors on
        the roof of your mouth. When cold objects hit it before your body has
        time to process, your nerves send a message to your brain that signal
        heat loss.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is what brings on that massive headache halfway through eating
        your ice cream.
      </p>
      <p>
        To combat brain freeze, hold your tongue against the roof of your mouth.
        This will help warm your sensors and get your brain out of panic mode.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>11. We Know How Many Licks it Takes to Get Through a Scoop</h3>
        The magic number is 50.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re just jealous we weren’t the person who got to do the taste test to
        get that data!

          Ice cream's origins are known to reach back as far as the second
          century B.C., although no specific date of origin nor inventor has
          been undisputably credited with its discovery. We know that Alexander
          the Great enjoyed snow and ice flavored with honey and nectar.
          Biblical references also show that King Solomon was fond of iced
          drinks during harvesting. During the Roman Empire, Nero Claudius Caesar
          (A.D. 54-86) frequently sent runners into the mountains for snow,
          which was then flavored with fruits and juices.</p>

       <p id="start">
         Over a thousand years later, Marco Polo returned to Italy from the
          Far East with a recipe that closely resembled what is now called
          sherbet. Historians estimate that this recipe evolved into ice cream
          sometime in the 16th century. England seems to have discovered ice
          cream at the same time, or perhaps even earlier than the Italians.
          "Cream Ice," as it was called, appeared regularly at the table of
          Charles I during the 17th century. France was introduced to similar
          frozen desserts in 1553 by the Italian Catherine de Medici when she
          became the wife of Henry II of France. It wasn't until 1660 that ice
          cream was made available to the general public. The Sicilian Procopio
          introduced a recipe blending milk, cream, butter and eggs at Café
          Procope, the first café in Paris.</p>

        <p id="early">
           The first official account of ice cream in the New World comes from a
           letter written in 1744 by a guest of Maryland Governor William Bladen.
           The first advertisement for ice cream in this country appeared in the
           New York Gazette on May 12, 1777, when confectioner Philip Lenzi
           announced that ice cream was available "almost every day." Records
           kept by a Chatham Street, New York, merchant show that President
           George Washington spent approximately $200 for ice cream during the
           summer of 1790. Inventory records of Mount Vernon taken after
           Washington's death revealed "two pewter ice cream pots." President
           Thomas Jefferson was said to have a favorite 18-step recipe for an
           ice cream delicacy that resembled a modern-day Baked Alaska. Check
           out President Jefferson's vanilla ice cream recipe here. In 1813,
           Dolley Madison served a magnificent strawberry ice cream creation at
           President Madison's second inaugural banquet at the White House.</p>

        <p id="now">
           Until 1800, ice cream remained a rare and exotic dessert enjoyed
           mostly by the elite. Around 1800, insulated ice houses were invented.
           Manufacturing ice cream soon became an industry in America, pioneered
           in 1851 by a Baltimore milk dealer named Jacob Fussell. Like other
           American industries, ice cream production increased because of
           technological innovations, including steam power, mechanical
           refrigeration, the homogenizer, electric power and motors, packing
           machines, and new freezing processes and equipment. In addition,
           motorized delivery vehicles dramatically changed the industry. Due to
           ongoing technological advances, today's total frozen dairy annual
           production in the United States is more than 1.6 billion gallons.</p>

        <p id="creations">
           Wide availability of ice cream in the late 19th century led to new
           creations. In 1874, the American soda fountain shop and the
           profession of the "soda jerk" emerged with the invention of the ice
           cream soda. In response to religious criticism for eating "sinfully"
           rich ice cream sodas on Sundays, ice cream merchants left out the
           carbonated water and invented the ice cream "Sunday" in the late
           1890's. The name was eventually changed to "sundae" to remove any
           connection with the Sabbath.</p>

        <p id="ww2">
           Ice cream became an edible morale symbol during World War II. Each
           branch of the military tried to outdo the others in serving ice cream
           to its troops. In 1945, the first "floating ice cream parlor" was
           built for sailors in the western Pacific. When the war ended, and
           dairy product rationing was lifted, America celebrated its victory
           with ice cream. Americans consumed over 20 quarts of ice cream per
           person in 1946.</p>

        <p id="culinary">
           In the 1940s through the ‘70s, ice cream production was relatively
           constant in the United States. As more prepackaged ice cream was sold
           through supermarkets, traditional ice cream parlors and soda
           fountains started to disappear. Now, specialty ice cream stores and
           unique restaurants that feature ice cream dishes have surged in
           popularity. These stores and restaurants are popular with those who
           remember the ice cream shops and soda fountains of days past, as well
           as with new generations of ice cream fans.</p>

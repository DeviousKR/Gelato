            Nothing beats the cool, creamy and sweet taste of ice cream on a
            sizzling summer’s day. Some people like vanilla, some chocolate,
            while others enjoy a nice refreshing cone of octopus with extra ink.
            What, you never heard of octopus flavoured ice cream? Then this list
            of the world’s weirdest ice cream flavours is for you!

            <h2>Lobster</h2>

            Ben and Bill’s Chocolate Emporium boasts a buttery Lobster based ice
            cream flavour that makes Bar Harbour, Maine famous. Each cone comes
            with fresh lobster folded into each bite. Remember to share and not
            be shellfish!

            <h2>Crocodile Egg</h2>

            In Davao City of The Philippines they make ice cream the good old
            fashioned way. No modern preservatives, they use nothing but milk,
            cream, sugar, and crocodile eggs.
          </p>

            <h2>Coronation Chicken</h2>

            In honour of the Queen of England’s Diamond Jubilee, chef Jacob
            Kennedy invented a chicken flavoured ice cream to celebrate the
            coronation. Kennedy was surprised when the dish turned out delicious,
            expecting it to taste quite strange.

            <h2>Octopus Ice Cream</h2>

            Taco Aisu is the name of the Japanese octopus ice cream which is
            guaranteed to tickle your tongue with its tentacles.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h2>Summer Corn</h2>

            When you think of summer, you think of heading out to local fairs,
            eating ice cream, and roasted ears of corn. Why not eat them
            together? You can if you’re in Santa Monica, California at the
            Sweet Rose Creamery where they found a way to mix the sweet taste of
            corn and the creamy taste of ice cream. Yum!
          </p>
          <p>
            <h2>Brie</h2>

            This scoop shop partnered with Président cheeses to create two
            flavors that include actual cheese as an ingredient. Alongside
            their feta flavor, the shop created this brie scoop, made with a
            sweet cream base blended with Président Creamy Brie, an oven-roasted
            garlic caramel swirl, and tiny bits of brioche French toast.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h2>Toasted miso giandjua crunch</h2>

            As part of their “Chef Series,” this scoop shop partnered with Top
            Chef Season 4 winner Stephanie Izard to create a unique flavor that
            features a Japanese fusion of hazelnut and paste made from fermented
            soybeans and barley or rice malt. Ten percent of proceeds from every
            pint sold will go toward Mission Musclethis link opens in a new tab.
          </p>

            <h2>Squid Ink</h2>

             This small hometown favorite is known for pushing the limits with
             their flavors (they even use salmon in one of their scoops during
             lent), and this black Japenese-inspired flavor is no different.
             Infused with squid ink, which gives it its color, this scoop is for
             the most adventurous ice cream eaters only.
           </p>
           <p>
             <h2>Barbecue</h2>

              This scoop shop really wants to “have fun and push the envelope”
              with their flavor experimentation. “We have found that most of our
              customers are ready to step out of their comfort zone and try new
              things,” the shop’s owner tells PEOPLE. “They may not like some of
              these new flavors, but at least they can say they tried it, and
              that’s exactly what we want.” The shop’s latest crazy flavor is
              made with homemade barbecue sauce that is mild, sweet and tangy,
              and mixed with candied pecans for a slight crunchy texture.
            </p>
            <p>
              <h2>Cheetos</h2>

              This ice cream shop is known for their outrageous toppings, but
              this might be their craziest flavor yet. Their “CHEAT-OHS” scoop
              is vanilla soft serve infused with Cheetos and then dusted dusted
              with with crumbs from the puffs. On Twitter, the shop’s owner said
               this is “probably one of the more disturbing flavors we’ve ever
               done. I hate how much I love it.”
            </p>
            <p>
              <h2>Pickles</h2>

              When this ice cream joint first tried out a scoop using pickles,
              they failed because of the brine’s acidity. “It immediately
              curdled our dairy base whenever the two came in contact,” they
              wrote on their blog. However, they were determined have a
              pickle-flavored ice cream in their shop, so they came up with a
              compromise: a cucumber flavored scoop mixed with dill herbs.
            </p>
            <p>
              <h2>Pizza crust</h2>

              This ice cream usually comes in a bowl, but is sometimes served on
              top of a slice of cinnamon pizza. It was recently debuted on The
              Chew, and each scoop features fresh plain pizza dough, which is
              toasted and charred before sitting in gelato base overnight and
              thrown into the ice cream maker the next morning.
